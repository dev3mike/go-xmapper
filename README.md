# xMapper üó∫Ô∏è - Dynamic Struct Transformer

Welcome to `xMapper`, where your Go structs gain superpowers! üöÄ Ever tired of manually copying fields from one struct to another? Forget about the hassle! `xMapper` automates the mapping of structs and dynamically transforms data as it flows from source to destination. It's not just about mapping; it's about transforming data effortlessly with power and style!

## Features

- **Automatic Struct Mapping**: Automate the boring stuff! Map fields between structs without writing boilerplate code.
- **Dynamic Data Transformation**: Apply transformations to your data dynamically as it's being mapped. Upper case, add suffixes, manipulate data on the go!
- **Extensible and Customizable**: Easily extend `xMapper` by adding your own custom transformation functions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to let you know exactly what went wrong during the mapping process.

## Getting Started

Here‚Äôs how to get started with `xMapper`:

### Installation

To start using `xMapper` in your Go project, simply use the `go get` command to retrieve the package:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/xmapper
```

Ensure your environment is set up with Go modules (Go 1.11+ required), and this command will manage everything for you, fetching the latest version of `xMapper` and adding it to your project's dependencies.

### Usage

1. **Define Your Transformers**: Create functions that match the `TransformerFunc` signature:

    ```go
    func toUpperCase(input interface{}) interface{} {
        str, ok := input.(string)
        if ok {
            return strings.ToUpper(str)
        }
        return input
    }
    ```

2. **Register Your Transformers**: Before you map your structs, make sure to register your transformers:

    ```go
    xmapper.RegisterTransformer("toUpperCase", toUpperCase)
    ```

3. **Map Your Structs**: Now let the magic happen:

    ```go
    type Source struct {
        Name string `json:"name" transformer:"toUpperCase"`
    }

    type Destination struct {
        Name string `json:"name"`
    }

    src := Source{Name: "frodo"}
    dest := Destination{}

    err := xmapper.MapStructs(&src, &dest)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Oops! Something went wrong:", err)
    }
    ```

### Example with Error Handling

Want to ensure your transformers are set up correctly? Here‚Äôs how to handle errors:

```go
err := xmapper.MapStructs(&src, &dest)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Failed to map structs:", err)
}
```
